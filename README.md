# Artificial-Neuron
Implementation of an artificial neuron.  
A Perceptron is an artificial neuron developed by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958.  
Today it is more common to use other models of artificial neurons, but the Perceptron allows a clear understanding of how a neural network works in mathematical terms, being excellent for beginners.
